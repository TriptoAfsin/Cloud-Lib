        <p class="abt-dtl" id="abt-dtl">Books have always been one of the best companions to the human being.<br><br> The information, ideas, creativity and visuality a book caries is immense if it is seen deeply. With the view of preserving the heritage of books and gaining the interest of the people of all walks of life through an online library, “Cloud Lib” have been introduced .<br><br>
            The students from all walks of life (school, college & universities) are engaged directly with books. No matter where they are, what they read they need books as a companion, let it be in the form notes or lectures. But the basic and a large portion of the information and  gets deprived when it is shortened.<br> Again, the literature enthusiasts might be or want to be reminisced with any books they read. The followers of many religions might want to read their holy prestigious religious book. The comic lover would want to read the whole series of the latest comic. But unavailability of these books might cut their inner want and hunger towards those books.<br> In order to make the books available to them within a second or two , ‘Cloud lib' has generated its service in the online platform which is suitable and available to all the people.
